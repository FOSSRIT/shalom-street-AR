			<h3>The Golden Age?</h3>
		<p>
			The period roughly from 1933 to 1955 is regarded by comics historians as the "Golden Age" because it was the "first wave" of new talent, 
			an era when classic comic-book characters such as Superman, Batman, and Captain America were created, as was the graphic language of 
			contemporary comics. "Today you call it the Golden Age," laughs Eisner. "Well, for those of us that were in the Golden Age, 
			we didn't know it. It was the Leaden Age as far as we were concerned!" Indeed, most of the comic-book artists and writers of this era 
			never emerged from poverty. They were underpaid wage slaves with no rights or royalties; the characters they created were owned and trademarked 
			by the comic-book publishers. Even Siegel and Shuster, creators of the world's first comic-book superhero, were bilked, earning a 
			paltry $130 from Harry Donenfeld for the first thirteen-page Superman story and having to negotiate for meager financial and creative
			participation in subsequent Superman strips and spin-offs (all Superman licensing fees were paid to Donenfeld's corporation, "Superman, Inc.").
			<br></br>
			The turning point for Superman's creators came in 1978--exactly forty years after Superman's first release. 
			During a TV talk-show promotion of the first Superman movie, an elderly gentleman rose from the audience and said in a soft voice: 
			"My name is Jerry Siegel. I co-created the character Superman on which they're making this movie, and I work at a supermarket bagging groceries." 
			The studio audience gasped. So did Jerry Robinson (a cartoonist, comic-book historian, and at that time the head of the National Cartoonists 
			Society), who was watching the show from home.
			<br></br>
			Robinson decided to launch a campaign aimed at Warner Brothers, which, as the parent company of DC Comics, owned the Superman copyright. 
			He wanted the media giant to compensate Siegel and Shuster for having created one of the most widely recognized characters on earth. 
			It would take many players, hundreds of arts organizations, and considerable legal maneuvering before the studio bowed to the pressure. 
			The inventors of Superman received a "created by" credit in the movie, and an annual stipend which continued for the rest of their lives. 
			Today, when a movie or TV series (not to mention comic book) is released featuring Superman, it bears the credit line: 
			"Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster," ensuring that future generations will know the genesis of the Man of Steel.

		<h3>The Golem And Superman </h3>
		<p> 
			Conceived by Siegel and Shuster while they were still in high school, Superman became the first comic-book character to cross over to virtually 
			every medium--novels (George Lowther's The Adventures of Superman, illustrated by Joe Shuster and published in 1942, featured the first 
			comic-book hero to appear in a novel), radio plays, television programs (including the current WB hit drama Smallville, 
			a postmodern look at Superman's early life in quintessential small-town America), theater (Harold Prince's 1966 Broadway musical It's A Bird, 
			It's A Plane, It's Superman), feature films, movie serials, animated short subjects, newspaper comic strips, Internet comics, 
			even popular music (in the rapper Eminem's 2002 song entitled "Superman," he compares himself to the Man of Steel).
			<br></br>
			The idea of Superman occurred to Jerry Siegel one hot summer night in 1933. The teenager had trouble falling asleep. 
			While lying in bed, he thought, "if only I could fly..." and began to envision a character who could fly--a character who was stronger, 
			more courageous, more invincible than he could ever be. Excited, Jerry hurried to his desk and wrote out in comic strip form the first Superman 
			story; then early the next morning he rushed over to the home of his artist friend Joe Shuster to share his idea. 
			Equally inspired, Joe immediately began to draw a prototype of the character. Thus was a hero born.
			<br></br>
			Superman actualized the adolescent power fantasies of its creators--two Jewish Depression kids craving a muscle-bound redeemer to 
			liberate them from the social and economic impoverishment of their lives. And, as Michael Chabon (author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel 
			The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, about two Siegel and Shuster-style cartoonists) notes, there's a parallel between Kavalier and 
			Clay's superhero creations and the Golem--the legendary creature magically conceived by the rabbi of medieval Prague to defend the 
			community from an invasion by its antisemitic enemies. Cartoonist, writer, and comic-book historian Will Eisner (creator of The Spirit) 
			also views Superman as a mythic descendant of the Golem and thus a link in the chain of Jewish tradition. "[Jews needed] a hero who could 
			protect us against an almost invincible force," Eisner says. "So [Siegel and Shuster] created an invincible hero."
			<br></br>
			The Superman narrative is also rich in Jewish symbolism. He is a child survivor named Kal-El 
			(in Hebrew, "All that is God") from the planet Krypton, whose population, a race of brilliant scientists, is decimated. 
			His parents send him to Earth in a tiny rocket ship, reminiscent of how baby Moses survived Pharaoh's decree to kill all Jewish newborn sons. 
			In the context of the 1930s, the story also reflects the saga of the Kindertransports--the evacuation to safety of hundreds of Jewish children,
			without their parents, from Austria, Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to Great Britain.
			<br></br>
			Angst-ridden adolescent fans, Jewish and not, shared Siegel and Shuster's feelings of helplessness and yearned for a super-savior--a fact that 
			was not lost on the comic-book publishers, who responded with a succession of new superhero creations, among them Wonder Man (created in May 
			1939 by Will Eisner) and Captain Marvel (created in February 1940 by writer Otto Binder and artist C. C. Beck). In the pre-Superman era, 
			brash, hard-boiled detectives (Ace King, Detective Dan, the aforementioned Slam Bradley) and humorous slapstick features (Curly and the Kids, 
			Sheldon Mayer's "Scribbly") had dominated the genre. After Superman, notes former Marvel Comics publisher and Spider Man co-creator Stan Lee 
			(Stanley Martin Lieber), "if artists wanted to be successful, they thought, 'I guess we better give our characters costumes and double 
			identities.'" Thus, for example, Batman secretly doubled as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, The Flash as police scientist Jay Garrick, The Ray as 
			reporter Happy Terrill, Wonder Woman as U.S. army major Diana Prince, and Captain America as police officer Steve Rogers.
