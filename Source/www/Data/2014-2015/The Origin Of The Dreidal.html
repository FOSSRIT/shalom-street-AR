			Reprinted with permission of the author from A Different Light: 
			The Hanukkah Book of Celebrationpublished by the Shalom Hartman Institute and Devora Publishing.
			<br> </br>
			Most of the laws of Hanukkah are related to the lighting of the menorah or hanukkiyah ;
			however, in this article we shall describe some of the customs of Hanukkah.
			The main difference between laws and customs is that laws stem 
			from rabbinic interpretations of the Torah and Talmud which then filter down to the Jewish people, 
			while customs usually start with the people and filter up to the rabbis. 
			Through customs, the Jewish people have shown their love for God and tradition and immeasurably enriched all aspects of Jewish observance.
		</p>
		<p> 
			The dreidel or sevivon is perhaps the most famous custom associated with Hanukkah. 
			Indeed, various rabbis have tried to find an integral connection between the dreidel and the Hanukkah story; 
			<br></br>
			The standard explanation is that the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin, which appear on the dreidel in the Diaspora,stand for nes gadol haya sham
			--"a great miracle happened there,"while in Israel the dreidel says nun, gimmel, hey, pey,which means "a great miracle happened here."
			<br></br>
			One 19th century rabbi maintained that Jews played with the dreidel in order to fool the Greeks if they were caught studying Torah, 
			which had been outlawed. Others figured out elaborate gematriot[numerological explanations based on the fact that every Hebrew letter has a 
			numerical equivalent] and word plays for the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin. For example, nun, gimmel, hey, shin in gematria equals 358, 
			which is also the numerical equivalent of mashiach or Messiah!
			<br></br>
			Finally, the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin are supposed to represent the four kingdoms which tried to destroy us [in ancient times]: 
			N = Nebuchadnetzar = Babylon; H = Haman = Persia = Madai; G = Gog = Greece; and S = Seir = Rome.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a matter of fact, all of these elaborate explanations were invented after the fact.
			The dreidel game originally had nothing to do with Hanukkah; it has been played by various people in various languages for many centuries.
			<br></br>	
			In England and Ireland there is a game called totum or teetotum that is especially popular at Christmastime. 
			In English, this game is first mentioned as "totum" ca. 1500-1520. The name comes from the Latin "totum," which means "all." 
			By 1720, the game was called T- totum or teetotum, and by 1801 the four letters already represented four words in English: 
			T = Take all; H = Half; P = Put down; and N = Nothing.
			Our Eastern European game of dreidel (including the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin) is directly based on the German equivalent of the totum game
			: N = Nichts = nothing; G = Ganz = all; H = Halb = half; and S = Stell ein = put in. 
			<br></br>
			In German, the spinning top was called a "torrel" or "trundl," and in Yiddish it was called a "dreidel," a "fargl," a "varfl" 
			[= something thrown], "shtel ein" [= put in], and "gor, gorin" [= all].
			<br></br>
			When Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, the dreidel was called, among other names, asevivon, which is the one that caught on.
			Thus the dreidel game represents an irony of Jewish history. In order to celebrate the holiday of Hanukkah, which celebrates our victory over 
			cultural assimilation, we play the dreidel game, which is an excellent example of cultural assimilation! 
			Of course, there is a world of difference between imitating non-Jewish games and worshipping idols, but the irony remains nonetheless.
