					The Jewish Calendar

			A few years ago, I was in a synagogue, and I overheard one man ask another, "When is Chanukkah this year?" 
			The other man smiled slyly and replied, "Same as always: the 25th of Kislev." 
			This humorous comment makes an important point: the date of Jewish holidays does not change from year to year. 
			Holidays are celebrated on the same day of the Jewish calendar every year, 
			but the Jewish year is not the same length as a solar year on the civil calendar 
			used by most of the western world, so the date shifts on the civil calendar.			
		</p>	
		
			<div align= "center"><h3>Background and History</h3></div>
		<p>
			The Jewish calendar is based on three astronomical phenomena: the rotation of the Earth about its axis (a day); 
			the revolution of the moon about the Earth (a month); and the revolution of the Earth about the sun (a year). 
			These three phenomena are independent of each other, so there is no direct correlation between them. 
			On average, the moon revolves around the Earth in about 29½ days. 
			The Earth revolves around the sun in about 365¼ days, that is, about 12.4 lunar months.
			<br></br>
			The civil calendar used by most of the world has abandoned any correlation between the moon cycles and the month, 
			arbitrarily setting the length of months to 28, 30 or 31 days.
			<br></br>
			
			The Jewish calendar, however, coordinates all three of these astronomical phenomena. 
			Months are either 29 or 30 days, corresponding to the 29½-day lunar cycle. Years are either 12 or 13 months, 
			corresponding to the 12.4 month solar cycle.
			<br></br>
			The lunar month on the Jewish calendar begins when the first sliver of moon becomes visible after the dark of the moon. 
			In ancient times, the new months used to be determined by observation. When people observed the new moon, they would notify the Sanhedrin. 
			When the Sanhedrin heard testimony from two independent, reliable eyewitnesses that the new moon occurred on a certain date, 
			they would declare the rosh chodesh (first of the month) and send out messengers to tell people when the month began.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem with strictly lunar calendars is that there are approximately 12.4 lunar months in every solar year, 
			so a 12-month lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar year and a 13-month lunar is about 19 longer than a solar year. 
			The months drift around the seasons on such a calendar: on a 12-month lunar calendar, the month of Nissan, which is supposed to occur in the Spring,
			would occur 11 days earlier in the season each year, eventually occurring in the Winter, the Fall, the Summer, and then the Spring again. 
			On a 13-month lunar calendar, the same thing would happen in the other direction, and faster.
			<br></br>
			To compensate for this drift, the Jewish calendar uses a 12-month lunar calendar with an extra month occasionally added. 
			The month of Nissan occurs 11 days earlier each year for two or three years, and then jumps forward 30 days, balancing out the drift. 
			In ancient times, this month was added by observation: the Sanhedrin observed the conditions of the weather, the crops and the livestock, 
			and if these were not sufficiently advanced to be considered "spring," then the Sanhedrin inserted an additional month into the calendar to 
			make sure that Pesach (Passover) would occur in the spring (it is, after all, referred to in the Torah as Chag he-Aviv, the Festival of Spring!).
			<br></br>
			A year with 13 months is referred to in Hebrew as Shanah Me'uberet (pronounced shah-NAH meh-oo-BEH-reht), literally: 
			a pregnant year. In English, we commonly call it a leap year. 
			The additional month is known as Adar I, Adar Rishon (first Adar) or Adar Alef (the Hebrew letter Alef being the numeral "1" in Hebrew). 
			The extra month is inserted before the regular month of Adar (known in such years as Adar II, Adar Sheini or Adar Beit). 
			Note that Adar II is the "real" Adar, the one in which Purim is celebrated, the one in which yahrzeits for Adar are observed, 
			the one in which a 13-year-old born in Adar becomes a Bar Mitzvah. Adar I is the "extra" Adar.
		</P>
		<p>
			In the fourth century, Hillel II established a fixed calendar based on mathematical and astronomical calculations. 
			This calendar, still in use, standardized the length of months and the addition of months over the course of a 19 year cycle, 
			so that the lunar calendar realigns with the solar years. Adar I is added in the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years of the cycle. 
			The current cycle began in Jewish year 5758 (the year that began October 2, 1997). 
			If you are musically inclined, you may find it helpful to remember this pattern of leap years by reference to the major scale: 
			for each whole step there are two regular years and a leap year; for each half-step there is one regular year and a leap year. 
			This is easier to understand when you examine the keyboard illustration below and see how it relates to the leap years above.

			In addition, Yom Kippur should not fall adjacent to Shabbat, because this would cause difficulties in coordinating the fast with Shabbat, 
			and Hoshanah Rabbah should not fall on Saturday because it would interfere with the holiday's observances. 
			A day is added to the month of Cheshvan or subtracted from the month of Kislev of the previous year to prevent these things from happening. 
			This process is sometimes referred to as "fixing" Rosh Hashanah. If you are interested in the details of how these calculations are performed, 
			see The Jewish Calendar: A Closer Look.
			</p>
			<div align= "center"><h3>Numbering of Jewish Years</h3></div>
			<p>
			The year number on the Jewish calendar represents the number of years since creation, 
			calculated by adding up the ages of people in the Bible back to the time of creation. 
			However, this does not necessarily mean that the universe has existed for only 5700 years 
			as we understand years. Many Orthodox Jews will readily acknowledge that the first six 
			"days" of creation are not necessarily 24-hour days (indeed, a 24-hour day would be 
			meaningless until the creation of the sun on the fourth "day"). 
			Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the 
			civil calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our L-rd," and we do not believe 
			Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. 
			(Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era),
			which are commonly used by scholars today.
			</p>
			<div align= "center"><h3>Months of the Jewish Year</h3></div>
			<p>
			The "first month" of the Jewish calendar is the month of Nissan, 
			in the spring, when Passover occurs. However, the Jewish New Year is in Tishri, 
			the seventh month, and that is when the year number is increased. 
			This concept of different starting points for a year is not as strange 
			as it might seem at first glance. The American "new year" starts in January, 
			but the new "school year" starts in September, and many businesses have 
			"fiscal years" that start at various times of the year. Similarly, the Jewish calendar 
			has different starting points for different purposes.
			The names of the months of the Jewish calendar were adopted during the time of Ezra, 
			after the return from the Babylonian exile. The names are actually Babylonian month names, 
			brought back to Israel by the returning exiles. Note that most of the Bible refers to months 
			by number, not by name.
			The Jewish calendar has the following months:

				The length of Cheshvan and Kislev are determined by complex calculations involving the time of day 
				of the full moon of the following year's Tishri and the day of the week that Tishri would occur 
				in the following year. 
				Note that the number of days between Nissan and Tishri is always the same. 
				Because of this, the time from the first major festival (Passover in Nissan) to the last major 
				festival (Sukkot in Tishri) is always the same.
			</p>
				<div align= "center"><h3>Days of the Jewish Week</h3></div>
			<p>
				Other than Shabbat, the name of the seventh day of the week, the Jewish calendar doesn't have names for the days of the week. 
				The days of the week are simply known as first day, second day, third day, etc. Sometimes they are referred to more fully as 
				First Day of the Sabbath, etc. Below is a list for those who are interested.
