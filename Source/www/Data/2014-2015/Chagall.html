			Marc Zakharovich Chagall was a Belarussian-Russian-French artist.Art critic Robert Hughes referred to Chagall as 
			"the quintessential Jewish artist of the twentieth century" (though Chagall saw his work as "not the dream of one people but of all humanity"). 
			An early modernist, he was associated with several major artistic styles and created works in virtually every artistic medium, 
			including painting, book illustrations, stained glass, stage sets, ceramic, tapestries and fine art prints.
			<br> </br>
			According to art historian Michael J. Lewis, Chagall was considered to be "the last survivor of the first generation of European modernists". 
			For decades, he "had also been respected as the world's preeminent Jewish artist". Using the medium of stained glass, 
			he produced windows for the cathedrals of Reims and Metz, windows for the UN, and the Jerusalem Windows in Israel. 
			He also did large-scale paintings, including part of the ceiling of the Paris Op√©ra.
			<br> </br>
			Before World War I, he traveled between St. Petersburg, Paris, and Berlin. During this period he created his own mixture and style of 
			modern art based on his idea of Eastern European Jewish folk culture. He spent the wartime years in Soviet Belarus, 
			becoming one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant-garde, founding the Vitebsk Arts College 
			before leaving again for Paris in 1922.
			<br></br>
			He had two basic reputations, writes Lewis: as a pioneer of modernism and as a major Jewish artist. 
			He experienced modernism's "golden age" in Paris, where "he synthesized the art forms of Cubism, Symbolism, and Fauvism, 
			and the influence of Fauvism gave rise to Surrealism". Yet throughout these phases of his style "he remained most emphatically a Jewish artist, 
			whose work was one long dreamy reverie of life in his native village of Vitebsk.""When Matisse dies," Pablo Picasso remarked in the 1950s, 
			"Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what colour really is"

		Marc Chagall was born Moishe Segal in a Jewish family in Liozna, near the city of Vitebsk 
		(Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire) in 1887. At the time of his birth, Vitebsk's population was about 66,000, 
		with half the population being Jewish. A picturesque city of churches and synagogues, it was called "Russian Toledo", 
		after a cosmopolitan city of the former Spanish Empire. As the city was built mostly of wood, little of it survived years of 
		occupation and destruction during World War II
		<br></br>
		Chagall was the eldest of nine children. The family name, Shagal, is a variant of the name Segal, which in a Jewish community was usually borne 
		by a Levitic family. His father, Khatskl (Zachar) Shagal, was employed by a herring merchant, and his mother, Feige-Ite, sold groceries 
		from their home. His father worked hard, carrying heavy barrels but earning only 20 roubles each month. 
		Chagall would later include fish motifs "out of respect for his father", writes Chagall biographer, Jacob Baal-Teshuva. 
		Chagall wrote of these early years: 
		<br></br><i>
			Day after day, winter and summer, at six o'clock in the morning, 
			my father got up and went off to the synagogue. There he said his usual prayer for some dead man or other. 
			On his return he made ready the samovar, drank some tea and went to work. Hellish work, the work of a galley-slave. 
			Why try to hide it? How tell about it? No word will ever ease my father's lot... 
			There was always plenty of butter and cheese on our table. Buttered bread, like an eternal symbol, was never out of my childish hands. 
		<br></br></i>
		One of the main sources of income of the Jewish population of the town was from the manufacture of clothing that was sold throughout Russia. 
		They also made furniture and various agricultural tools. From the late 18th century to the First World War, 
		the Russian government confined Jews to living within the Pale of Settlement, which included modern Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, 
		almost exactly corresponding to the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth recently taken over by Imperial Russia. 
		This caused the creation of Jewish market-villages (shtetls) throughout today's Eastern Europe, 
		with their own markets, schools, hospitals, and other community institutions.
		<br></br>
		Most of what is known about Chagall's early life has come from his autobiography, My Life. 
		In it, he described the major influence that the culture of Hasidic Judaism had on his life as an artist. 
		Vitebsk itself had been a center of that culture dating from the 1730s with its teachings derived from the Kabbalah. 
		Chagall scholar Susan Goodman describes the links and sources of his art to his early home:
		<br></br><i>
		Chagall's art can be understood as the response to a situation that has long marked the history of Russian Jews. 
		Though they were cultural innovators who made important contributions to the broader society, 
		Jews were considered outsiders in a frequently hostile society... Chagall himself was born of a family steeped in religious life; 
		his parents were observant Hasidic Jews who found spiritual satisfaction in a life defined by their faith and organized by prayer.
		<br></br></i>
		Chagall formed a relationship with Sholom Dovber Schneerson, and later with Menachem M. Schneerson.
